- 👋 Hi, I’m @sendetsu
- 📫 This account is meant to track of all the miscellaneous projects I've wanted to take over the years but always pushed to later
- 📫 I may or may not do some coding streams on http://twitch.tv/sendetsu
- 👀 I’m interested in backend stuff, automation, streaming, vtubers and things
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Node, C#/.NET, Python and whatever I get my hand on
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate for now, don't hesitate to chat if you catch me on stream tho
